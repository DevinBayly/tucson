[REGISTRATION REQUIRED](https://libcal.library.arizona.edu/event/6225949)

Learn how to find, extract & prepare [LiDAR](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html) data in order to create a 3D print of terrain in this mashup event that combines the CATalyst Maker Studio & Maptime. We'll explore tools that allow you to take LiDAR data and transform it into a data product that can be 3D printed. You'll leave this mashup workshop with a voucher to claim the 3D print that you made from the Libraries [3D printing services.](https://new.library.arizona.edu/visit/print/3D)  

*2*-5 PM in CATalyst Studios, Main Library, University of Arizona [(map)](https://maps.arizona.edu/campus360/?shareId=cffd90949e3d2b8aec3f6e9d727e66680d6c2973)
