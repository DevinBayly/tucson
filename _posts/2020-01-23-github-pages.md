Come by for the first ever Maptime Tucson! We'll be playing around with creating GitHub static web pages for resumes, portfolios or project sites. No experience with GitHub necessary. We'll learn together!

Thursday, January 23rd, 2020 from 3-5PM at CATalyst Studios, Main Library - University of Arizona.
