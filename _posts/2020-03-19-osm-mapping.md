Learn how to edit & contribute to OpenStreetMap - the Wikipedia of maps. OpenStreetMap is a crowd-sourced, open-source version of Google Maps or Apple Maps. Contributors all over the world map their communities. People all over the world map areas when disasters strike in order to create better maps for on-the-ground responders through efforts like Humanitarian OpenStreetMap. 

We'll learn the basics of how to be a good OpenStreetMap Editor and try out some mapping of an area in need.
