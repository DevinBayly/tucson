    <p>!Introductory piece about maptimes</p>
    <p>This session is devoted to a tool known as a github page which is a simple way to host web content without
        needing to understand how to run a server, or purchase a domain name on the internet. This is good news because
        it lets us create pages for our resumes, organizations, projects, and much more all for free! This workshop will
        be fairly free form, and will begin with some additional information but the rest of the time will be all hands
        on with the goal of everyone leaving today with their own github page.</p>

    <h2 id="what-are-pages">What are Pages?</h2>
    <p>According to Github</p>
    <p>~~~</p>
    <p><em>GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and
            running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub
            Pages’ content and style remotely via the web or locally on your computer.</em></p>
    <p>~~~</p>
    <p>Again these pages can be used for</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blogs</li>
        <li>Project documentation</li>
        <li>Books</li>
        <li>Wikis</li>
        <li>Personal websites</li>
        <li>Professional portfolios</li>

    <ul>

    <h2 id="forking-as-a-workflow">Forking as a workflow</h2>
    <p>If while looking at the examples you thought <strong>“But I found a really cool page, and if it just had a few
            tweaks it’d work great for me”</strong> then you’re in luck, because there’s something called forking that
        lets you do just that! The term to <strong>“Fork”</strong> means to copy a pre-existing repository (definition:
        a project) on github to your own account. This makes it possible to quickly get up to speed with your own github
        related projects. Please</p>
    <h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
    <p>This is the syntax that is used in the simplest cases to create content in your github page. See <a
            href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">here</a> for instructions on how to use.</p>
