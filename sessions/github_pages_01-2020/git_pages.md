# What are Pages?
According to Github

\~~~

*GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pagesâ€™ content and style remotely via the web or locally on your computer.*

\~~~

# Examples  
Again these pages can be used for 

* Blogs
* Project documentation
* Books
* Wikis
* Personal websites
* Professional portfolios


## Why do GeoSpatial users care about Pages?

Pages are a great way to share your resume or create a portfolio of either static or web maps. 

# Examples of Pages

# Getting Started on your own page


**"But I found a really cool page, and if it just had a few tweaks it'd work great for me"**


That's the idea!

# Forking

"*copy a pre-existing repository (definition: a project) on github to your own account*"

* Enables efficient initialization of github related projects

# First steps

* Go to this link [https://guides.github.com/features/pages/](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)
* ! Kiri are there any other things I should attach here, or are people mostly going to be going to the page and using it that way?


# Advanced options

* Configuring your theme
! not sure what info to add here as it is uknown to me

# Advanced options
* Project pages
    * create new repository
    * go to settings 
    * set up gitpages hosting
    * go to "username.github.io/my-new-repo" to see the result
    * modify with glee!


# Go forth and Page!
