# Map Time Session 1: Github Pages

!Introductory piece about maptimes

This session is devoted to a tool known as a github page which is a simple way to host web content without needing to understand how to run a server, or purchase a domain name on the internet. This is good news because it lets us create pages for our resumes, organizations, projects, and much more all for free! This workshop will be fairly free form, and will begin with some additional information but the rest of the time will be all hands on with the goal of everyone leaving today with their own github page.  

## Collaborative note taking
Please write your name and university affiliation below, plus amount of github pages knowledge.

## What are Pages?
According to Github

\~~~

*GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pagesâ€™ content and style remotely via the web or locally on your computer.*

\~~~

Again these pages can be used for 

* Blogs
* Project documentation
* Books
* Wikis
* Personal websites
* Professional portfolios


## Why do GeoSpatial users care about Pages?

!I might have to leave this part to you Kiri !

## Examples of Pages

* The Research Technologies Data & Visualization team's [Demos & Documentation](https://ua-researchcomputing-data-visualization.github.io/Demos-and-Docs/)
* Map time chapters around the globe (Country?) [MapTime](http://maptime.io/)
* Random search for geospatial github pages
    * [Benny Cheung](https://bennycheung.github.io/geospatial-granular-computing)
    * [Zimbabwe GeoSpatial Data](http://zimgeospatial.github.io/)
* Loads of others: [Example Collection](https://github.com/collections/github-pages-examples)

# Getting Started on your own page
## Forking as a workflow
If while looking at the examples you thought **"But I found a really cool page, and if it just had a few tweaks it'd work great for me"**  then you're in luck, because there's something called forking that lets you do just that! The term to **"Fork"** means to copy a pre-existing repository (definition: a project) on github to your own account. This makes it possible to quickly get up to speed with your own github related projects. Please 

## Markdown

This is the syntax that is used in the simplest cases to create content in your github page.
See [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for instructions on how to use.
