!I might have to leave this part to you Kiri !
## Examples of Pages

* The Research Technologies Data & Visualization team's [Demos & Documentation](https://ua-researchcomputing-data-visualization.github.io/Demos-and-Docs/)
* Map time chapters around the globe (Country?) [MapTime](http://maptime.io/)
* Random search for geospatial github pages
    * [Benny Cheung](https://bennycheung.github.io/geospatial-granular-computing)
    * [Zimbabwe GeoSpatial Data](http://zimgeospatial.github.io/)

# Getting Started on your own page
## Forking as a workflow
If while looking at the examples you thought **"But I found a really cool page, and if it just had a few tweaks it'd work great for me"**  then you're in luck, because there's something called forking that lets you do just that! The term to **"Fork"** means to copy a pre-existing repository (definition: a project) on github to your own account. This makes it possible to quickly get up to speed with your own github related projects 
## Markdown

This is the syntax that is used in the simplest cases to create content in your github page.
See [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for instructions on how to use.
